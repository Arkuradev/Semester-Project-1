## About the Project

Semester Project 1 assignment was described as a contract from a client where the client wanted a site where they could showcase their local museum.
The client wanted a modern responsive website where they could keep their visitors/people interested in learning about the museum informed.

As for the assignment itself this was a pure HTML/CSS assignment with focus on using semantic HTML and developing the site using the DRY principles.
I was not allowed to use anything but HTML and CSS for this project, so there is no frameworks used for this project.
