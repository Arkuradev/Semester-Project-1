            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p>Welcome to DCSM, a community science museum location in Drammen, Norway. 
                Our website is dedicated to providing information about our museum, including exhibits, 
                events and educational resources. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders
                of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration
                of the world around us. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits.
                This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on many varied subjects of science to explore.
                Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science
                come to life. (apart from the dinosaur exhibits - they only come to life at night when everyone’s
                gone home. )
