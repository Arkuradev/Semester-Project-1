                <h4>Cosmology</h4>
                <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic
                    exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky
                    and what we can see and know about the universe
                    around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and 
                    galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about 
                    the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
                    
                    Follow the journey of our solar exploration:
                    from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, 
                    to the latest exploration of the planets in our 
                    solar system</p>

                <h4>Evolution</h4>
                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled
                    with the question of our origins. Where do we come from
                    and how did we get here? 
                    Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have 
                    had a framework for exploring and understanding our
                    place in the world.
                    
                    Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the
                    species we know today have evolved over time. 
                    You can also take some time to meet a few of the 
                    creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly
                    Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>
