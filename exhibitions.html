                <h4>Cosmology</h4>
                <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic
                    exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky
                    and what we can see and know about the universe
                    around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and 
                    galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about 
                    the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
                    
                    Follow the journey of our solar exploration:
                    from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, 
                    to the latest exploration of the planets in our 
                    solar system</p>

                <h4>Evolution</h4>
                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled
                    with the question of our origins. Where do we come from
                    and how did we get here? 
                    Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have 
                    had a framework for exploring and understanding our
                    place in the world.
                    
                    Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the
                    species we know today have evolved over time. 
                    You can also take some time to meet a few of the 
                    creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly
                    Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

                <h4>Biology and Medicine</h4>
                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major
                    breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights
                    into the great wonders of the tiny world. 
                    For many people their life expectancy is much longer
                    and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the 
                    growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series
                    of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take
                    a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant. 
                    
                    Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

                <h4>Robotics and AI</h4>
                <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and
                    artificial intelligence are the science of the future. 
                    From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of
                    robotics, the future is here. 
                    You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the
                    Robot. </p>

                <h4>Ecology</h4>
                <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet. 

                    In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.</p>
